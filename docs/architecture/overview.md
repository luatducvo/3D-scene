# System overview

A user creates a Scene, uploads photos or one video of a room, and starts a Job. The worker runs the eight Stages on the pipeline's Target, publishes the result, and the browser then shows the room in 3D and finds Objects by text. Terms are defined in [GLOSSARY.md](../../GLOSSARY.md).

## Processes

| Process | Code | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| frontend | `frontend/` | Next.js app; talks only to scene-api |
| scene-api | `backend/services/scene-api` | REST and SSE API; stores uploads on the Target; serves Publication files; Search |
| scene-worker | `backend/services/scene-worker` | claims queued Jobs, runs every Stage on the Target, publishes |
| Postgres + pgvector | `backend/migrations/001_init.sql` | Scenes, Jobs, Stage Runs, Objects with embeddings, events |
| scene-compute | `backend/services/scene-compute` | optional; runs Algorithms on a GPU host behind an HTTP contract |

Compose (`compose.yaml`) runs these under three profiles: `backend` (Postgres, scene-api, scene-worker), `frontend`, and `local-gpu` (scene-compute on this machine). `uv run main.py up` starts the first two.

## Data flow

1. **Upload**: scene-api stores files under `raw/` in the Scene's Target Workspace. The browser first shrinks photos to the long side ingest expects.
2. **Process**: `POST /process` inserts a queued Job. The worker claims it, clears earlier Stage outputs (keeping `raw/`), and runs ingest → recon → align → mesh → segment → lift → embed → objects on the one Target. Each Stage is one Compute Run and leaves a Manifest and a Stage Run.
3. **Publish**: the worker downloads only `objects/`, `embeddings/` and `mesh/` into `DATA_DIR/scenes/{scene}/{job}/`, then writes Objects and embeddings to the database and points the Scene at that Publication, in one transaction. Frames and every other intermediate stay on the Target.
4. **Explore**: the browser loads the mesh, point cloud and Object membership from the Publication, lists Objects, and runs Searches (the query is embedded on the Target, then compared in pgvector).

Progress reaches the browser as `scene_events` rows that the store writes with each transition and `GET /events` streams as SSE.
